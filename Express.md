## Express

[An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

#### **Node** allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. 

#### **Node Benefits**

- Great performance
- Devs can use plain old JavaScript
- Many other new and popular languages convert into JavaScript 
- NPM provides access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages.
- Portable
- Active third-party-ecosystem

[What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)

#### **Open source** devs from around the world use NPM.

#### **NPM** consists of three distinct components:

- website
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- registry

#### **Use**  NPM to:
- incorporate packages
- Download tools 
- Run packages without downloading using npx.
- Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
- Form virtual teams by using organizations.
- Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
 You can follow NPM on twitter @npmjs.

[What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)

#### **Test Driven Development (TDD)** is when you compine coding, testing and design in the form of refactoring.

**The Rules of TDD:**

- write a “single” unit test describing an aspect of the program
- run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature
- write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass
- “refactor” the code until it conforms to the simplicity criteria
- repeat, “accumulating” unit tests over time

**Benifits to TDD**

- Significant reductions in defect rates, at the cost of a moderate increase in initial development effort.
- These overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases
- Generally a higher degree of “internal” or technical quality, for instance improving the metrics of cohesion and coupling [source](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'tdd))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1))

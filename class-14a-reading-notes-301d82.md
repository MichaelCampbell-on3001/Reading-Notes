1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD? **REST is an architectural system centered around resources and hypermedia, via HTTP protocols. CRUD is a cycle meant for maintaining permanent records in a database setting. CRUD principles are mapped to REST commands to comply with the goals of RESTful architecture.**

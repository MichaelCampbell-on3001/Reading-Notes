# Socket.io

## [Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

#### Five fun facts about Web Sockets

- Designed to work over HTTP ports 443 and 80 as well as to support HTTP proxies 

- WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol.

- Most browsers support the protocol.

- WebSocket provides full-duplex communication.

- Using browser developer tools, developers can inspect the WebSocket handshake as well as the WebSocket frames.

## [Socket.io Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/)

**Socket.IO** is a JavaScript library for **real-time** web applications. It has **two parts** a **client-side** library that runs in the browser, and a **server-side** library for **node.js**. [^1]

[^1]: A **real-time application** is an application that functions within a period that the user senses as immediate or current.

## [Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

### **WebSocket is a communication Protocol while Socket.IO is a library.**

#### Websocket:
- Provides full-duplex communication, which helps in persisting the connection established between the Client and the Web Server.
- lives up to the standards and provides the accuracy and efficiency stream events to and from with negligible latency.
- WebSocket removes the overhead and reduce complexity.
- Makes real-time communication effortless and efficient.

#### Socket.IO
- Handles all the degradation of technical alternatives to get full-duplex communication in real-time.
- Handles the various support level and the inconsistencies from the browser.
- Gives the additional feature room support for basic publish infrastructure and thinks like automatic reconnect.

TCP stands for **transmission control protocol**.
It is a reliable and a **connection-oriented transport protocol**.
The TCP data can be delivered
successfully and accurately.  Many
applications such as web, email and FTP
used TCP.  **Before** TCP transmits data it
will use a **three-way handshake** to
establish a connection.

**Role Based Access**

`user` -> `role` -> `rights`

- Acces may be based on job function
- Access rights are associated with roles
- Users authenticate themselves to the system

**RBAC Benefits**

- The policy does not need to be updates.
- The system doesn't need to change when people leave or join. 
- Users can be limited to a subset of the files.

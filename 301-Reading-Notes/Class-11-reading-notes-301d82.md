Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database |
| are table based databases  | are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. |
| have predefined schema | dynamic schema for unstructured data |
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
| SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language  | focused on collection of documents |

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? **Highly structured**
2. Give a real world example. **If you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records**
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? **structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data**
4. Give a real world example. **You could build a scalable book app.  For each book, the item, ISBN, Book Title, Edition Number, Author Name, and AuthorID are stored as attributes in a single document. .**
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? ** A document based database.**
6. Which type of database is best for scalability? **MySQL and MongoDB.**

1. What does SQL stand for? **Structured Query Language**
2. What is a relational database? ** A type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.**
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with? **Tables**
4. What is a ‘schema’? ** the organization or structure of a database**
5. What is a NoSQL database? ** Non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. **
6. How does it work? **Document databases store data in documents similar to JSON**
7. What is inside of a Mongo database? **Documents that contain a data structure composed of field and value pairs.**
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. **While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.**
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? **Compatibility issues with SQL instructions**

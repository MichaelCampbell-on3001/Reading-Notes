## [Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

John Sonmez author of ["How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/) has a simple set of set to follow to use for any algorithm programming program. Sonmez says "as much as 70% or a programmers time should be spent in steps 1-3.

1. Read the problem completely twice. . . maybe even three or four times. Can you explain the problem to someone else?
1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data. John Sonmez “Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!” It is recommended that you solve the problem with at least three different inputs
1. Optimize the manual steps. As yourself, "is there a better way?" Are there any steps that can be eliminated that won't change the outcome?
1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code. Write a "to-do" list or a narrative of the your solution. "Step one request this, step 2 return that..." **or** "As a dev I want to first request this to return that...".  
1. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code. This step requires the least amount of problem solving. It should be a 1 to 1 from your comments and pseudo code to actual code, 
1. Optimize the real code. It is worth taking a moment to reflect on the code and suggest ways it could be optimized. It gives a good impression and it is good practice to always keep optimization in mind.

**And remember, go into every interview with confidence!**

## [How to think like a programmer](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)
### by Richard Reis

According to the author of this article being a better programmer means having a more effective way for problem solving.

 **Have a framework** - Reis suggests to first have a framework. Have a system to solve problems. 
 1. Understand - One way to help yourself understand is to write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it (or thing… some people use a rubber duck).
2. Plan - Refrain from jumping right in to coding. Write down the **EXACT** steps you intend on taking and read over it again after a short break.
3. Divide - To avoid crying do not attempt to solve on big problem. Instead, approach it by breaking it up into smaller problems. Identify the steps you need to take and begin coding in small incriments. Solve each smaller probelm one by one. A good rule to follow is go from least to most dependant.
4. Debug - If something went wrog in your solution then examine it step by step. 
5. Reassess - Even if everything went fine, take a step back and look at the problem from another point of view. 

Other important steps to take is to research and pracatice. Find something that invloves micro-problem solving that is enjoyable to do outside of programming and developing. 

## [The 5 Whys](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)
The 5 WHys is a technique for providing counter measures to complicated problems.
From the article: "The [5 whys] method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring."

The 5 Whys technique can be used for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving simple to moderate problems. Often times, you are directed to the root of the problem very quickly.

How to use the 5 whys:
1. Assemble a team
2. Defin the Problem
3. Ask the first "why"
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
5. Know When to Stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures


You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses. Keep in mind you may have to ask why a few more times than 5 as more complicated problems have more layers.

Also try the Appreciation technique. It is a question-based approach. As why a fact is an important to receive that most amount of info on it.

## [What the heck is the event loop anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) with Philip Rogers

This video discusses the call stack and event loops in Javascript. Rogers went into great detail to explain the call stack and provided great visual components.

**Concurrency & the event loop** - While you can't run more than one javacript command concurrently, but by utilizing the power of the browser concurrent calls are possible.

By using an event loop you can set it up so the stack can continue to run while making an async call.

## [The Super Mario Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0)

Mark Rober discussed how to tricking your brain into learning more.  
Durign a study Rober disovered that subject that didn't view failing in a negative light attempted the task twice as often as their counterparts that did have a negative view of failing.
Those that took more attempts learned more and had more success. 
It is important to remember the successes. Learn from the setbacks and don't view failing a challenge as a penalty. 
View challenges through the Super Mario effect and shift focus from falling into pits to saving the pincess.

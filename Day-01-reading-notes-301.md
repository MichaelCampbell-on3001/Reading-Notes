### [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

###### Question:   
What is a “component”?

###### Answer:
A **component** is a modular and reusable set of defined functionality intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionalities.

According to the article linked above 
> A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

###### Question:
What are the characteristics of a component?

###### Answer:
The characteristics or a compnent are reusability, replaceability, they are not context specific, extensible, encapsulated and independent.[^1]

[^1]: Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

# Reading-Notes
This site houses my reading notes from Code Fellows.

~~###### Code 102 - Intro to Software Development
###### Code 201 - Foundations of Software Development~~ [^1]


###### Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development

###### Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

[^1]: Since it had been a while since my last attempt at 301, I created a new repo for my reading notes. My original reading notes repo can be found [here](https://github.com/MichaelCampbell-on3001/2021-reading-notes)
